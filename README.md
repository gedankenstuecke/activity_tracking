# Visualizing Activity Tracking Data
Some data viz examples done with *Fitbit* and *Apple HealthKit* data.

For the Fitbit data there is an example that downloads intraday-data through Fitbit's own API as well 
as an example that is based on the `JSON` formatted data that you can download from 
Open Humans. 

For Healthkit it is based on the exports that you will get from Open Humans through the HealthKit integration. 
Due to a bug in the HealthKit exporter that renders timestamps unusable these data aren't fully usable yet.
